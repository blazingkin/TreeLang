TreeLang
=====

TreeLang is an experimental programming language.

The core of tree lang is of course - the tree.

All data is modeled inside a tree. In this tree, you define NodeTypes and Transformations which transition a node from one type to another.
This is a radical departure from the classical function-based model.

By taking up this new programming language structure, there are instant gains in parallelism and program safety.
